Project Description:

The Work Day Scheduler is an app designed to make your life easier.  You can document and save all upcoming events for the day allowing you to focuse on the important things.  The app uses colour to break down the day; grey for the past, red for current time, and green for the future.  This feature makes it easy for people of all walks of life to understand the function of the app.
